## FAQ

### 1. What is the _Client Code_?

_Client_ means _client of classes, defined as part of a pattern_, which is merely a caller of the given methods or a user of the given classes. In other words, it's the part of your application's code that uses the pattern's classes.

### 2. I don't understand the roles you're referring to in RealWorld examples

Take a look at the conceptual example first. There you'll find detailed descriptions of each class in a pattern, its role, and connection to other classes.
