# Design Patterns in Python

Python examples of all classic GoF design patterns.

- [x] **Conceptual** examples show the internal structure of patterns, including detailed comments.

- [ ] **RealWorld** examples show how patterns can be used in real-world Python applications.

## Requirements

These examples require Python 3.7 and newer.

All examples can be launched via the command line, using the Python executable as follows:

```sh
python src/Path-to-example/main.py
```

For the best DX, I recommend working with examples with these IDEs:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

## FAQ

### 1. What is the _Client Code_?

_Client_ means _client of classes, defined as part of a pattern_, which is merely a caller of the given methods or a user of the given classes. In other words, it's the part of your application's code that uses the pattern's classes.

### 2. I don't understand the roles you're referring to in RealWorld examples

Take a look at the conceptual example first. There you'll find detailed descriptions of each class in a pattern, its role, and connection to other classes.
